# Merchant Admins:
- An admin can create multiple merchant admins within each business.
- Each merchant admin has authority over a specific aspect or category within the business, such as food, electronics, etc.
- Merchant admins can create items/products within their assigned category.

# Merchant Staff:
- Merchant admins can manage multiple merchant staff members within their category.
- Merchant staff members work under a specific merchant admin and are responsible for day-to-day operations.
- Each staff member may be assigned to a specific location or area within the business.

# Example Scenario:
- Business: Restaurant
- Admin creates Merchant Admin 1 (Food) for managing food-related items.
- Merchant Admin 1 creates items/products for different food categories (e.g., appetizers, main courses, desserts).
- Merchant Admin 1 assigns Merchant Staff 1 to handle orders and operations in one location (e.g., Bansankari) and Merchant Staff 2 for another location (e.g., BTM).
- Each Merchant Staff member manages orders and ensures smooth operations within their assigned location.
